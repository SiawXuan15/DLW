Myth: COVID-19 is no worse than the flu.\\nFact: While both COVID-19 and the flu are respiratory illnesses, COVID-19 is generally more severe and can cause more serious complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.\\n2. Myth: Young people are not at risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.\\nFact: While it is true that older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19, young people can still get seriously ill from the virus.\\n3. Myth: You can't spread COVID-19 if you don't have symptoms.\\nFact: People with COVID-19 can spread the virus to others even if they don't have symptoms. This is why it is important for everyone to wear masks, practice social distancing, and wash their hands frequently, even if they feel healthy.\\n4. Myth: You can protect yourself from COVID-19 by gargling with bleach or using a hair dryer.\\nFact: There is no scientific evidence to support these or other similar claims about protecting yourself from COVID-19. The best ways to protect yourself are to get vaccinated, wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands frequently.\\n5. Myth: The COVID-19 vaccine can give you the virus.\\nFact: The COVID-19 vaccine does not contain the virus and cannot give you the virus. It works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus.\\n\\nIt is important to rely on credible sources of information, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), for accurate and up-to-date information about COVID-19.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 428, 'prompt_tokens': 18, 'total_tokens': 446, 'completion_time': 0.665151302, 'prompt_time': 0.002676095, 'queue_time': 0.06878013, 'total_time': 0.667827397}, 'model_name': 'mixtral-8x7b-32768', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_c5f20b5bb1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-4c9dd282-cabb-477a-9503-0cca5cede47b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 18, 'output_tokens': 428, 'total_tokens': 446})"
